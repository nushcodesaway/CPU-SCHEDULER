## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ FCFS (First Come First Serve)
Processes are executed in the order they arrive.

### 2️⃣ SJF (Shortest Job First)
Process with smallest burst time executes first.

### 3️⃣ Round Robin
Each process gets a fixed time quantum.

## 📈 Performance Metrics Calculated

- Completion Time (CT)
- Waiting Time (WT)
- Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Average WT
- Average TAT
